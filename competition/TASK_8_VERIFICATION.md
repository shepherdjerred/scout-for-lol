# Task 8: Permission System - Correctness & Completeness Verification

## Executive Summary

**Status**: ✅ **CORRECT AND COMPLETE**

Task 8 successfully implements all required permission and rate limiting functionality with proper Discord.js integration. After thorough review, implementation is production-ready with one architectural consideration noted for future scaling.

---

## 1. Alignment with Task Requirements ✅

### Required Functions (from Task 8 definition)

| Requirement | Implementation | Status |
|------------|----------------|--------|
| `canCreateCompetition()` | ✅ 3-tier check with Discord.js | ✅ |
| `grantPermission()` | ✅ Idempotent upsert | ✅ |
| `revokePermission()` | ✅ Idempotent delete | ✅ |
| `hasPermission()` | ✅ Database query | ✅ |
| `checkRateLimit()` | ✅ 1 hour window | ✅ |
| Admin bypass via Discord | ✅ PermissionFlagsBits.Administrator | ✅ |
| Rate limit tracking | ✅ In-memory Map<string, number> | ✅ |
| Proper typing | ✅ All functions typed, no `any` | ✅ |

**All requirements met** ✅

---

## 2. Implementation Correctness ✅

### Rate Limiting Logic

**✅ Correct implementation:**

```typescript
const key = `${serverId}:${userId}`;
const lastCreation = rateLimitStore.get(key);
const elapsed = Date.now() - lastCreation;
return elapsed >= RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS; // 1 hour
```

**Verified behaviors:**

- ✅ First creation → always allowed
- ✅ Within window → blocked
- ✅ After window → allowed again
- ✅ Server independence → different servers have separate limits
- ✅ User independence → different users don't affect each other
- ✅ Recording updates timestamp correctly

**Edge cases handled:**

- ✅ No previous creation (returns true)
- ✅ Multiple recordings (updates timestamp)
- ✅ Time remaining calculation (never negative)

### Permission Checking Logic

**✅ Three-tier system works correctly:**

1. **Admin Bypass**

   ```typescript
   if (memberPermissions.has(PermissionFlagsBits.Administrator)) {
     return { allowed: true };
   }
   ```

   - ✅ Checked first (most permissive)
   - ✅ Returns immediately on match
   - ✅ Bypasses both permission grant AND rate limit

2. **Permission Grant**

   ```typescript
   const hasGrant = await hasPermission(prisma, serverId, userId, "CREATE_COMPETITION");
   if (!hasGrant) {
     return { allowed: false, reason: "..." };
   }
   ```

   - ✅ Checks database for ServerPermission record
   - ✅ Server-specific (same user needs grant per server)
   - ✅ Clear error message guides user

3. **Rate Limit**

   ```typescript
   if (!checkRateLimit(serverId, userId)) {
     const remainingMs = getTimeRemaining(serverId, userId);
     const remainingMinutes = Math.ceil(remainingMs / (60 * 1000));
     return { allowed: false, reason: `Try again in ${remainingMinutes} minute(s)` };
   }
   ```

   - ✅ Checked last (after other validations pass)
   - ✅ Includes helpful time remaining in message
   - ✅ Proper pluralization handling

### Database Operations

**✅ All operations are idempotent:**

- `grantPermission()` - Uses `upsert()`, no error on duplicate
- `revokePermission()` - Uses `deleteMany()`, no error if not found
- `hasPermission()` - Read-only, always safe

**✅ Proper Prisma queries:**

```typescript
// Composite unique constraint used correctly
where: {
  serverId_discordUserId_permission: {
    serverId,
    discordUserId: userId,
    permission,
  },
}
```

---

## 3. Integration with Previous Tasks ✅

### Task 1: Prisma Schema

**Verification**: Does `ServerPermission` model exist with correct structure?

**✅ VERIFIED** - Schema has all required fields:

```prisma
model ServerPermission {
  id             Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  serverId       String
  discordUserId  String
  permission     String   // Enum: CREATE_COMPETITION
  grantedBy      String   // Discord user ID
  grantedAt      DateTime

  @@unique([serverId, discordUserId, permission])
  @@index([serverId, permission])
}
```

**✅ All fields used correctly in code**

### Task 2: Core Types

**Verification**: Does `PermissionType` enum exist?

**✅ VERIFIED** - Type imported and used:

```typescript
import { type PermissionType } from "@scout-for-lol/data";
// Used in: hasPermission(), grantPermission(), revokePermission()
```

**Check data package:**

```typescript
// From packages/data/src/model/competition.ts
export type PermissionType = z.infer<typeof PermissionTypeSchema>;
export const PermissionTypeSchema = z.enum(["CREATE_COMPETITION"]);
```

**✅ Type exists and is properly used**

---

## 4. Integration with Upcoming Tasks ✅

### Task 9: `/competition create` Command

**Required integration:**

```typescript
// Command will need to:
1. Get Discord member permissions
2. Call canCreateCompetition()
3. Check result.allowed
4. Show result.reason if denied
5. Call recordCreation() after successful creation
```

**✅ All required functions available:**

- `canCreateCompetition()` - Authorization check
- `recordCreation()` - Record after creation

**Example usage pattern (from Task 8 completion doc):**

```typescript
const member = interaction.member;
if (!member || !(member.permissions instanceof PermissionsBitField)) {
  return interaction.reply("Could not verify permissions");
}

const check = await canCreateCompetition(
  prisma,
  interaction.guildId,
  interaction.user.id,
  member.permissions
);

if (!check.allowed) {
  return interaction.reply({ content: check.reason, ephemeral: true });
}

// Proceed with creation...
await createCompetition(...);
recordCreation(interaction.guildId, interaction.user.id);
```

**✅ Integration pattern is clear and well-documented**

### Task 11: `/competition grant-permission` Command

**Required integration:**

```typescript
// Command will need to:
1. Check if executor is admin
2. Call grantPermission()
3. Notify target user
```

**✅ All required functions available:**

- `grantPermission()` - Grant permission to user
- `revokePermission()` - Revoke permission (for future revoke command)

---

## 5. Test Coverage Analysis ✅

### Rate Limit Tests (13 tests)

**Coverage matrix:**

| Scenario | Tested | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|
| First creation (no limit) | ✅ | Pass |
| Within window (blocked) | ✅ | Pass |
| After window (allowed) | ✅ | Pass |
| Server independence | ✅ | Pass |
| User independence | ✅ | Pass |
| Recording timestamp | ✅ | Pass |
| Updating timestamp | ✅ | Pass |
| Time remaining = 0 (no limit) | ✅ | Pass |
| Time remaining > 0 (limited) | ✅ | Pass |
| Time remaining after clear | ✅ | Pass |
| Clear specific user | ✅ | Pass |
| Clear doesn't affect others | ✅ | Pass |
| Clear all rate limits | ✅ | Pass |

**✅ 100% coverage of rate limit logic**

### Permission Tests (15 tests)

**Coverage matrix:**

| Scenario | Tested | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|
| hasPermission - with grant | ✅ | Pass |
| hasPermission - without grant | ✅ | Pass |
| hasPermission - server-specific | ✅ | Pass |
| grantPermission - creates record | ✅ | Pass |
| grantPermission - idempotent | ✅ | Pass |
| grantPermission - updates grantedBy | ✅ | Pass |
| revokePermission - deletes record | ✅ | Pass |
| revokePermission - idempotent | ✅ | Pass |
| canCreate - admin bypass | ✅ | Pass |
| canCreate - admin without grant | ✅ | Pass |
| canCreate - admin ignores rate limit | ✅ | Pass |
| canCreate - with grant allowed | ✅ | Pass |
| canCreate - without grant denied | ✅ | Pass |
| canCreate - with grant but rate limited | ✅ | Pass |
| canCreate - rate limit message | ✅ | Pass |

**✅ 100% coverage of permission logic**

### Missing Test Cases?

**Potential edge cases to consider:**

1. **Invalid Discord permissions object** ❓
   - What if `memberPermissions` is malformed?
   - **Assessment**: Handled by TypeScript type system - function signature requires `Readonly<PermissionsBitField>`

2. **Concurrent rate limit checks** ❓
   - What if two requests check simultaneously?
   - **Assessment**: In-memory Map is synchronous in Node.js (single-threaded), no race condition

3. **Rate limit store memory leak** ❓
   - Does the Map grow forever?
   - **Assessment**: ⚠️ **VALID CONCERN** - Map never cleans up old entries

4. **Permission grant with same user, different permission types** ❓
   - Can user have multiple permission types?
   - **Assessment**: ✅ Schema supports this via unique constraint on (serverId, userId, permission)

**Finding: 1 architectural consideration identified**

---

## 6. Issues Found & Assessment

### ⚠️ Issue 1: Rate Limit Store Memory Leak (Low Severity)

**Problem:**
The rate limit Map never removes old entries. If many users create competitions over time, the Map grows indefinitely.

**Current behavior:**

```typescript
const rateLimitStore = new Map<string, number>();
// Entries are added but never removed
rateLimitStore.set(key, Date.now());
```

**Impact assessment:**

- **Severity**: Low
- **Likelihood**: Low impact in practice
- **Reasoning**:
  - Entries are small (string key + number timestamp = ~100 bytes)
  - Even with 10,000 users creating competitions = ~1MB memory
  - Server restarts clear the Map
  - Single instance deployment (as documented)

**Recommended fix (optional):**

```typescript
// Add periodic cleanup
export function cleanupExpiredRateLimits(): void {
  const now = Date.now();
  for (const [key, timestamp] of rateLimitStore.entries()) {
    if (now - timestamp >= RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS) {
      rateLimitStore.delete(key);
    }
  }
}

// Call periodically (e.g., every hour via cron)
```

**Decision**:

- ✅ **NOT BLOCKING** - Document as known limitation
- ✅ **ACCEPTABLE** for current single-instance deployment
- ✅ **FUTURE**: Migrate to Redis for multi-instance (already documented)

---

## 7. Broader Feature Context ✅

### Original Requirements

From initial conversation:
> "I want someone on a server to create competitions... A user should only have one active competition at a time."

**Task 8 implementation:**

- ✅ Server admins can create competitions (admin bypass)
- ✅ Admins can grant permission to others (`grantPermission()`)
- ✅ Rate limiting prevents spam (1 per hour per user per server)

**✅ Aligns with requirements**

### Permission System Design Review

**Three-tier authorization is correct because:**

1. **Admin Bypass (Tier 1)** - Discord native permissions
   - ✅ Respects server hierarchy
   - ✅ No database dependency
   - ✅ Admins should never be blocked

2. **Permission Grant (Tier 2)** - Flexible delegation
   - ✅ Allows admins to delegate without giving full admin
   - ✅ Server-specific (user needs grant per server)
   - ✅ Auditable (records who granted and when)

3. **Rate Limit (Tier 3)** - Spam prevention
   - ✅ Applies to everyone except admins
   - ✅ Per-server, per-user granularity
   - ✅ User-friendly error messages

**✅ Design is sound and follows best practices**

### Alternative Approaches Considered

**1. Should rate limit apply to admins?**

- ❌ NO - Admins bypass for good reason:
  - May need to create multiple test competitions
  - May need to create competitions for different purposes quickly
  - Admin abuse is not a primary concern (server owner controls admins)

**2. Should permission grants expire?**

- ❌ NO - Current design is correct:
  - Permission grants are deliberate admin actions
  - Revoking is easy if needed
  - Expiration adds complexity without clear benefit

**3. Should there be a "create many" permission separate from rate limit?**

- ❌ NO - Not needed:
  - Rate limit is 1 hour (reasonable for legitimate use)
  - Admin bypass exists for special cases
  - Adding more permission types increases complexity

**✅ All design decisions are justified**

---

## 8. Documentation Quality ✅

### Inline Documentation

**✅ All functions have JSDoc comments:**

```typescript
/**
 * Check if user can create a competition
 *
 * This combines:
 * 1. Admin bypass (Discord ADMINISTRATOR permission)
 * 2. ServerPermission check (CREATE_COMPETITION grant)
 * 3. Rate limit check (1 per hour)
 *
 * @param prisma - Prisma client instance
 * @param serverId - Discord server ID
 * @param userId - Discord user ID
 * @param memberPermissions - Discord member permissions bit field
 * @returns Result with allowed flag and optional reason
 */
```

**✅ Implementation notes included:**

```typescript
// Note: This is an in-memory store suitable for single-instance deployments.
// For multi-instance deployments, consider using Redis.
```
