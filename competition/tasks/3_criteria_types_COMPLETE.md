# Task 3: Criteria Types - ✅ COMPLETE

## Summary
Successfully implemented the discriminated union type system for competition criteria with six different criteria types, all with proper Zod validation, TypeScript type narrowing, and comprehensive test coverage.

## Completed Items

### ✅ Six Criteria Schemas Defined

1. **MostGamesPlayedCriteria**
   - Fields: `type: "MOST_GAMES_PLAYED"`, `queue: CompetitionQueueType`
   - All queue types supported (SOLO, FLEX, RANKED_ANY, ARENA, ARAM, ALL)

2. **HighestRankCriteria**
   - Fields: `type: "HIGHEST_RANK"`, `queue: "SOLO" | "FLEX"`
   - Only ranked queues supported (Arena/ARAM don't have ranks)

3. **MostRankClimbCriteria**
   - Fields: `type: "MOST_RANK_CLIMB"`, `queue: "SOLO" | "FLEX"`
   - Only ranked queues supported (tracks LP gains)

4. **MostWinsPlayerCriteria**
   - Fields: `type: "MOST_WINS_PLAYER"`, `queue: CompetitionQueueType`
   - All queue types supported

5. **MostWinsChampionCriteria**
   - Fields: `type: "MOST_WINS_CHAMPION"`, `championId: number`, `queue?: CompetitionQueueType`
   - ChampionId is required (positive integer)
   - Queue is optional (if not specified, counts wins across all queues)

6. **HighestWinRateCriteria**
   - Fields: `type: "HIGHEST_WIN_RATE"`, `minGames: number`, `queue: CompetitionQueueType`
   - MinGames defaults to 10 if not provided
   - MinGames must be positive

### ✅ Discriminated Union Created

- `CompetitionCriteriaSchema` using `z.discriminatedUnion()`
- Uses `type` field as discriminator
- TypeScript properly narrows types based on `type` value
- No `any` types used anywhere

### ✅ Type Safety Features

- **Proper validation**: Each field validated with appropriate Zod schema
- **Type narrowing**: TypeScript correctly narrows union types when checking `type` field
- **Compile-time safety**: Accessing wrong fields for a type results in compile error
- **Runtime validation**: Zod validates data at runtime with clear error messages

## Test Results

**94 tests passing** (38 new tests for criteria types):

### Test Coverage

- **MostGamesPlayedCriteria**: 5 tests
  - Valid criteria with all queue types
  - Rejects missing queue
  - Rejects invalid queue

- **HighestRankCriteria**: 5 tests
  - Accepts SOLO and FLEX
  - Rejects ARENA, ARAM, and other non-ranked queues
  - Rejects missing queue

- **MostRankClimbCriteria**: 4 tests
  - Accepts SOLO and FLEX
  - Rejects ARENA and RANKED_ANY

- **MostWinsPlayerCriteria**: 3 tests
  - Accepts all queue types
  - Rejects missing queue

- **MostWinsChampionCriteria**: 6 tests
  - Accepts with championId and queue
  - Accepts with championId only (no queue)
  - Rejects missing, negative, or zero championId

- **HighestWinRateCriteria**: 5 tests
  - Accepts valid minGames
  - Applies default minGames of 10
  - Rejects negative or zero minGames
  - Accepts all queue types

- **Discriminated Union**: 10 tests
  - Parses all 6 criteria types correctly
  - Fails on invalid type
  - Type-specific validation works (e.g., rank queues only for HIGHEST_RANK)
  - TypeScript type narrowing verified
  - Type-specific properties accessible after narrowing

## Verification

| Check | Result | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Tests** | ✅ PASS | 94 tests, 0 failures |
| **Typecheck** | ✅ PASS | No errors |
| **Lint** | ✅ PASS | No errors |
| **Dagger CI** | ✅ PASS | Data package check successful |

## Files Modified

- `packages/data/src/model/competition.ts` - Added 6 criteria schemas and discriminated union
- `packages/data/src/model/competition.test.ts` - Added 38 comprehensive tests

## Type Narrowing Example

The discriminated union works perfectly with TypeScript's type narrowing:

```typescript
const criteria = CompetitionCriteriaSchema.parse({
  type: "MOST_WINS_CHAMPION",
  championId: 157,
  queue: "SOLO",
});

// TypeScript knows the exact type based on discriminator
if (criteria.type === "MOST_WINS_CHAMPION") {
  // ✅ TypeScript knows championId exists here
  console.log(criteria.championId); // No error!
  console.log(criteria.queue);      // No error!
}
```

## Design Decisions

1. **Queue restrictions**: HIGHEST_RANK and MOST_RANK_CLIMB only allow SOLO/FLEX because other queues don't have ranked systems.

2. **Optional queue for MOST_WINS_CHAMPION**: Allows competitions like "most wins with Yasuo across all queues" or "most wins with Yasuo in solo queue".

3. **Default minGames**: Set to 10 to prevent edge cases where someone with 1-0 record has 100% win rate.

4. **Positive integers**: ChampionId and minGames must be positive to prevent invalid data.

5. **Discriminated union**: Uses `type` field as discriminator for optimal TypeScript support and clear API.

## Next Steps

Ready to proceed to Task 4: Snapshot Schemas, which will define what data is captured at competition boundaries based on these criteria types.
