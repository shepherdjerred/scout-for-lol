# Task 13: Command - Competition Invite

## Overview
Implement `/competition invite` command for competition owners to invite specific users to their competitions.

## Dependencies
- Task 6 (Competition queries)
- Task 7 (Participant management)
- Task 9 (Command structure)

## Files to Create/Modify
- `packages/backend/src/discord/commands/competition/invite.ts` (new file)
- `packages/backend/src/discord/commands/competition/index.ts` - add subcommand

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Subcommand with options:
   - `competition-id` (required integer)
   - `user` (required Discord user)
2. Permission: only competition owner can invite
3. Validation:
   - Competition exists and not cancelled/ended
   - Target user has linked Player account
   - Target user not already participant
   - Under participant limit
4. Creates participant with INVITED status
5. Sends DM to invited user
6. Success message to inviter

## Example Implementation
```typescript
export async function executeCompetitionInvite(
  interaction: ChatInputCommandInteraction
) {
  const competitionId = interaction.options.getInteger('competition-id', true);
  const targetUser = interaction.options.getUser('user', true);
  const userId = interaction.user.id;
  const serverId = interaction.guildId!;

  const competition = await getCompetitionById(competitionId);

  if (!competition) {
    await interaction.reply({
      content: 'Competition not found',
      ephemeral: true,
    });
    return;
  }

  // Check ownership
  if (competition.ownerId !== userId) {
    await interaction.reply({
      content: 'Only the competition owner can invite participants',
      ephemeral: true,
    });
    return;
  }

  // Get target user's Player
  const player = await prisma.player.findUnique({
    where: {
      serverId_discordId: { serverId, discordId: targetUser.id },
    },
  });

  if (!player) {
    await interaction.reply({
      content: `${targetUser.username} doesn't have a linked League account`,
      ephemeral: true,
    });
    return;
  }

  await addParticipant(competitionId, player.id, 'INVITED', userId);

  // Send DM
  try {
    await targetUser.send(
      `You've been invited to compete in **${competition.title}**!\n` +
      `Use \`/competition join competition-id:${competitionId}\` to participate.`
    );
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn(`Failed to DM user ${targetUser.id}:`, error);
  }

  await interaction.reply({
    content: `Invited ${targetUser.username} to ${competition.title}`,
    ephemeral: true,
  });
}
```

## Validation
- Run `bun run typecheck:all`
- Test in Discord
