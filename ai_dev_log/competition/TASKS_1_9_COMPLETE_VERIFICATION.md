## INTEGRATION VERIFICATION

### Cross-Task Dependencies

**Task 9 depends on**:

- Task 2 ✅ Uses CompetitionVisibility, CompetitionQueueType
- Task 3 ✅ Uses CompetitionCriteria union
- Task 5 ✅ Calls validateOwnerLimit(), validateServerLimit()
- Task 6 ✅ Calls createCompetition()
- Task 8 ✅ Calls canCreateCompetition(), recordCreation()

**All dependencies verified working!**

### Data Flow Verification

1. **User Input** → Zod validation (Task 9) ✅
2. **Validated Input** → Permission check (Task 8) ✅
3. **Permission OK** → Business validation (Task 5) ✅
4. **Validation OK** → Create competition (Task 6) ✅
5. **Competition Created** → Stored in DB (Task 1) ✅
6. **Criteria Parsed** → Domain types (Task 3) ✅

**Complete data flow working end-to-end!**
