# Task 2: Core Types - Correctness & Completeness Verification

## Executive Summary

**Status**: ✅ **CORRECT AND COMPLETE**

Task 2 has been thoroughly reviewed against the Prisma schema, broader feature requirements, and upcoming tasks. All types are correct, complete, and properly integrated.

---

## 1. Alignment with Prisma Schema ✅

### Enum Values Match Database Schema

| Type                      | Task 2 Enum Values             | Prisma Field          | Database Storage  | Status   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------- | ----------------- | -------- |
| **CompetitionVisibility** | OPEN, INVITE_ONLY, SERVER_WIDE | `visibility String`   | Stored as strings | ✅ Match |
| **ParticipantStatus**     | INVITED, JOINED, LEFT          | `status String`       | Stored as strings | ✅ Match |
| **SnapshotType**          | START, END                     | `snapshotType String` | Stored as strings | ✅ Match |
| **PermissionType**        | CREATE_COMPETITION             | `permission String`   | Stored as strings | ✅ Match |

**Verification**: All enum values are stored as strings in Prisma, which matches our Zod string enum schemas. ✅

### Status Calculation Matches Schema Fields

The `getCompetitionStatus()` function uses:

- ✅ `isCancelled: Boolean` from Prisma
- ✅ `startDate: DateTime?` from Prisma (nullable)
- ✅ `endDate: DateTime?` from Prisma (nullable)
- ✅ `seasonId: String?` from Prisma (nullable)

**Status Logic Correctness**:

```
Priority Order (highest to lowest):
1. isCancelled=true → CANCELLED (overrides everything)
2. endDate in past → ENDED
3. startDate in future → DRAFT
4. between startDate and endDate → ACTIVE
5. seasonId only (no dates) → DRAFT
6. no dates AND no seasonId → ERROR (invalid state)
```

This logic is **correct** because:

- Cancellation should always take precedence ✅
- Ended competitions can't be "active" ✅
- Future competitions are drafts ✅
- Season-based competitions start as drafts until dates are resolved ✅

---

## 2. Broader Feature Requirements ✅

### Requirement: One Active Competition Per Owner

**From original requirements**: "A user should only have one active competition at a time"

**Status in Task 2**:

- ✅ Status calculation is pure and deterministic
- ✅ Can reliably determine if a competition is ACTIVE
- ⏳ Validation logic will be in Task 5 (not Task 2's responsibility)

**Conclusion**: Task 2 provides the building block (`getCompetitionStatus`), validation comes later. ✅

### Requirement: Competitions Store Criteria

**From Prisma schema**:

```prisma
criteriaType     String // Enum stored as string
criteriaConfig   String // JSON stored as string
```

**Status in Task 2**:

- ✅ `CompetitionQueueType` enum created for use in criteria configs
- ⏳ Actual criteria schemas are Task 3 (not Task 2)

**Conclusion**: Task 2 correctly scopes to foundational types only. ✅

### Requirement: Multiple Competitions Over Time

**From Task 1 fix**: Users can create multiple competitions over time (unique constraint removed)

**Status in Task 2**:

- ✅ Status calculation doesn't prevent multiple competitions
- ✅ Pure function can be called for any competition
- ✅ No global state or side effects

**Conclusion**: Supports multiple competitions correctly. ✅

---

## 3. Integration with Upcoming Tasks ✅

### Task 3: Criteria Types

**Dependency**: Uses `CompetitionQueueType` from Task 2

**Verification**:

- ✅ Task 3 will use `CompetitionQueueType` in criteria schemas
- ✅ Example: `MostGamesPlayedCriteria` has `queue: CompetitionQueueType`
- ✅ Task 2 correctly provides this foundational type

**Status**: Ready for Task 3 ✅

### Task 5: Validation

**Dependency**: Uses `getCompetitionStatus()` from Task 2

**Verification**:

- ✅ Validation will call `getCompetitionStatus()` to check for active competitions
- ✅ Status function is pure and side-effect free
- ✅ Validation can safely call it multiple times

**Status**: Ready for Task 5 ✅

### Task 6: Competition Queries

**Dependency**: Uses branded types and status calculation

**Verification**:

- ✅ `CompetitionId` and `ParticipantId` prevent ID confusion
- ✅ Status calculation will be used when parsing competitions from DB
- ✅ Types are exported and available

**Status**: Ready for Task 6 ✅

### Task 21: Lifecycle Cron

**Dependency**: Uses status calculation for state transitions

**Verification**:

- ✅ Cron will call `getCompetitionStatus()` to find DRAFT→ACTIVE transitions
- ✅ Cron will call `getCompetitionStatus()` to find ACTIVE→ENDED transitions
- ✅ Status function handles all edge cases (just started, just ended, etc.)

**Status**: Ready for Task 21 ✅

---

## 4. Edge Cases & Assumptions ✅

### Edge Case: Both Dates AND SeasonId Set

**Scenario**: Competition has both `startDate/endDate` AND `seasonId`

**Current Behavior**: Status function uses dates and ignores seasonId

**Is This Correct?**

- ✅ YES - This is an XOR constraint that will be validated in Task 5
- ✅ Status function assumes data is already validated
- ✅ If both are set (invalid state), function still returns a deterministic status
- ✅ Task 5 validation will prevent this scenario from being saved

**Assumption Documented**: Status function assumes validated data ✅

### Edge Case: Timezone Handling

**Scenario**: Competitions stored in UTC, server runs in different timezone

**Current Behavior**:

```typescript
const now = new Date(); // Creates UTC timestamp internally
if (now >= endDate) { ... }
```

**Is This Correct?**

- ✅ YES - JavaScript Date objects are always UTC internally
- ✅ Prisma stores DateTime as ISO 8601 with timezone info
- ✅ When retrieved, Prisma converts to JavaScript Date (UTC)
- ✅ Comparison works correctly regardless of server timezone

**Verification**: Date comparisons are timezone-safe ✅

### Edge Case: Exactly At Boundary Times

**Scenario**: Current time is exactly `endDate` or exactly `startDate`

**Current Behavior**:

```typescript
if (now >= endDate) return "ENDED"; // Inclusive
if (now < startDate) return "DRAFT"; // Exclusive
```

**Is This Correct?**

- ✅ YES - Competition ends AT endDate (inclusive) → ENDED
- ✅ Competition is draft BEFORE startDate (exclusive) → DRAFT
- ✅ Tests verify this behavior explicitly

**Tests Cover**:

- ✅ "just ended (edge case)" - 1 second ago
- ✅ "endDate is exactly now" - boundary condition
- ✅ "just started (edge case)" - 1 second ago

**Conclusion**: Boundary conditions handled correctly ✅

## 5. Type Safety & Best Practices ✅

### Branded Types

- ✅ `CompetitionId` and `ParticipantId` use `.brand()`
- ✅ Prevents mixing IDs at compile time
- ✅ Runtime validation ensures positive integers only

### Exhaustive Pattern Matching

- ✅ All helper functions use `ts-pattern` with `.exhaustive()`
- ✅ TypeScript compiler will catch missing cases
- ✅ Adding new enum values forces code updates

### Pure Functions

- ✅ `getCompetitionStatus()` is pure (no side effects)
- ✅ Helper functions are pure (no state mutation)
- ✅ All functions are deterministic (same input → same output)

### No `any` Types

- ✅ Verified: 0 `any` types in `competition.ts`
- ✅ All parameters properly typed
- ✅ All return types explicit

### Zod Validation

- ✅ All enums have Zod schemas
- ✅ Branded types have validation (positive, int)
- ✅ Runtime validation catches invalid data

## 6. Missing Pieces? ❓

### ❌ NOT Missing (Correct Scoping)

These are intentionally NOT in Task 2:

1. **Criteria schemas** → Task 3
2. **Snapshot data schemas** → Task 4
3. **Validation functions** → Task 5
4. **Competition parsing from Prisma** → Task 6
5. **Leaderboard entry types** → Task 19

### ✅ Potentially Missing (Review)

**Question 1**: Do we need a schema for dates to validate they're actually Date objects?

**Answer**: NO - TypeScript ensures `Date` type at compile time. Prisma returns Date objects. Runtime validation not needed. ✅

**Question 2**: Do we need a helper to format dates for display?

**Answer**: NO - This is presentation logic, not domain types. Can be added later when building Discord commands. ✅

**Question 3**: Should we validate that `endDate > startDate`?

**Answer**: NO - This is business logic validation (Task 5), not type validation. Task 2 provides the types, Task 5 validates relationships. ✅

**Question 4**: Should `CompetitionQueueType` have a mapping to the existing `QueueType`?

**Answer**: NO - These are separate concepts:

- `QueueType` (state.ts): Match queue types from Riot API (lowercase: "solo", "flex")
- `CompetitionQueueType` (competition.ts): Criteria filtering (uppercase: "SOLO", "FLEX")
- They serve different purposes and shouldn't be conflated. ✅

## 7. Potential Issues Found 🔍

### ⚠️ Naming Collision (Already Fixed)

**Issue**: Original implementation used `QueueType` which collides with existing type

**Resolution**: ✅ Renamed to `CompetitionQueueType`

**Impact**: None - caught and fixed before integration
