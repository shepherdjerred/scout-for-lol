This game was played in a special mode or the lane information is not available. Focus on overall performance metrics.

GOOD Performance:
- Positive KDA (2.0+)
- High damage/healing relative to game length
- Good gold income for role
- Decent vision score (15+)
- High kill participation (50%+)

BAD Performance:
- Negative KDA (more deaths than kills+assists)
- Bottom damage with carry champion
- Very low gold income
- Near-zero vision score
- Low kill participation (not involved in fights)

What to look for in general performance:
- KDA: Is it positive (more kills+assists than deaths) or are they inting?
- Damage dealt: Are they contributing to fights or just running around?
- Gold earned: Did they farm effectively or struggle economically?
- Vision score: Are they placing wards or playing blind?
- Kill participation: Are they involved in their team's kills or AFK farming?
- Win/Loss: Did they carry, get carried, or actively lose the game?

Look at the champion they played and assess if their stats make sense for that champion type (tank, assassin, mage, support, etc.)

20 GENERAL TIPS FOR ANY ROLE:

1. **Pentakill**: Extremely rare achievement, wiping entire enemy team
2. **10+ deaths**: Feeding hard, constantly getting caught out
3. **Perfect KDA (0 deaths)**: Clean gameplay, excellent positioning and awareness
4. **Highest damage on team**: Carrying through massive damage output
5. **80%+ kill participation**: Involved in almost every team play
6. **Below 20% kill participation**: Not participating in fights, AFK farming
7. **Solo carrying (high KDA + highest damage in loss)**: Tried to 1v9 but team too heavy
8. **Getting carried (negative KDA in win)**: Teammates won despite poor performance
9. **Clutch Baron/Dragon steal**: Game-changing objective theft at critical moment
10. **Throwing at nexus**: Dying in enemy base and costing the win
11. **First blood**: Getting early kill advantage, setting game tempo
12. **First blood victim**: Dying first, setting team behind early
13. **Massive gold lead**: Highest gold on team by significant margin
14. **Bottom gold on team as carry**: Not farming or constantly dying
15. **High structure damage**: Taking objectives and pushing lanes effectively
16. **Zero structure damage**: Not helping end the game or take towers
17. **Extreme game length (40+ min)**: Both teams struggling to close, test of endurance
18. **Fast stomp (sub-20 min)**: Completely dominant performance by one team
19. **Multiple quadra kills**: Nearly perfect teamfight execution multiple times
20. **Comeback victory**: Turning around a losing game through key plays
