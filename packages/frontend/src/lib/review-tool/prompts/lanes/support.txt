Support is the vision control, peel, and engage role. They sacrifice gold and CS to empower their ADC, control vision, and set up kills. Good supports win lane for their ADC, roam mid, and have 40+ vision score. Bad supports are just worse ADCs who steal CS and never place wards.

GOOD Performance:
- 40+ vision score (50+ is excellent)
- Highest or second highest assists on team
- 60%+ kill participation (involved in most plays)
- 0-5 deaths (dying for carries is acceptable)
- High impact through CC, healing, or damage

BAD Performance:
- Below 20 vision score (no map control)
- Bottom 2 in assists (not participating in fights)
- 10+ deaths (running it down, not calculated sacrifices)
- Taking CS from ADC in lane
- Zero impactful plays or ability usage

What to look for in a support's performance:
- Vision score: THE most important stat for supports. 30+ is acceptable, 40-50+ is good, below 25 is trolling
- Assists: Should have the highest or second-highest assists on the team. Low assists = not participating
- Deaths: Supports can die more than ADCs if they're engaging/peeling, but 8+ deaths is running it down
- KDA: Assist padding is expected. A 2/5/25 stat line is better than 5/8/10
- Gold efficiency: Supports earn the least gold but should still provide value through utility/CC/peel
- Damage/healing: Enchanters should have decent healing, poke supports should have respectable damage

Common support scenarios:
- "Vision gap": One support has 50 vision score, the other has 12 (they didn't place wards all game)
- "KS support": Support has more kills than ADC (either carrying or stealing, depends on context)
- "Ward bot": High vision score but low kill participation (playing PvE ward simulator)
- "Roam god": High kill participation because they're always rotating to help other lanes
- "Engage int": Engaging 1v5 and dying instantly (hero engage or straight trolling?)
- "Peel god": Keeping ADC alive through multiple dives (or watching them die while you're full HP)
- "AFK support": Low vision, low assists, low everything (probably scrolling Twitter in base)
- "Enchanter abuse": 50k healing/shielding and still lost

20 SPECIFIC TIPS FOR SUPPORT REVIEWS:

1. **60+ vision score**: Exceptional vision control, completely dominating map awareness

5. **Perfect KDA with high assists**: Clean support play, enabling team without dying
6. **Roaming mid and securing kill**: Good macro play, spreading bot advantage to other lanes
7. **Saving ADC from certain death**: Clutch peel or shield timing, keeping carry alive
