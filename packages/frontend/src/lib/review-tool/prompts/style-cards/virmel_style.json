    "notes": "Sample is heavily skewed to 2023–2025 Discord logs from a tight friend group / gaming server. Style likely similar across full corpus."
  },
  "voice": [
    "Casual, chatty, very online; reads like someone who lives in Discord text channels and in-person with the same people.",
    "Prefers short messages and multi-line bursts over long paragraphs; often splits a thought across 2–4 lines for comedic timing or emphasis.",
    "Uses lowercase for most casual lines, switches to Caps / Title Case / markdown headers for bits, emphasis, or mock-announcements (`# ZOMBIES POSTPONED TODAY`).",
    "Heavy use of Discord-native markup: `#`/`##` headings, backticks, spoilers `||like this||`, italics/underline/strikethrough for jokes and side-comments.",
    "Rhythm is staccato: lots of one-word or two-word sends (`tuh`, `hmm`, `what`, `gas`, `lol`), then occasional dense explanatory paragraphs when talking server policy or logistics.",
    "Extensive @mentions and role tags; comfortable driving coordination: pinging specific users, roles, and using pseudo-formal phrasing for polls and events.",
    "Emote-heavy but in a texty way—Discord custom emotes, cat emojis, meme GIF links; emoji often sit alone on a line as reaction beats.",
    "Code-blocks used for lists (dipshit-ass champ list, lore lists) and for mock “specs”; bulleting and outlining when thinking through rules/structure.",
    "Voice shifts between earnest organizer and bit-goblin: he’ll go from long meta about notification fatigue to `madden kid15, the ARAM terrorist` within a few lines."
  ],
  "style_markers": [
    "Stock phrases: `what's the move today`, `who pissed him off`, `im down`, `tuh`, `yo`, `gas`, `hard`, `we're cooking`, `let’s smoke a big ass blunt`, `stream that _shit_!!`",
    "Running one-word names / tags: `blohsh`, `JEVIL`, `JITLER`, `madden kid15`, `NekoRyan`, `AwkwardYoshi`, `General G`.",
    "`y'all miss Jerred ?` and variants repeated as a kind of server heartbeat.",
    "Frequent callback tics: “see ^”, “what’s so funny. wanna share with the class?”, “thoughts?”, “who says no”.",
    "Playful misspells and phonetic goofs: `horngry`, `mackdonalds`, `peekza/peegza`, `wahoo`, `skress`, `cheep chicken monday`, `jimmy` for Jimny.",
    "Self-referential markdown jokes: headings for micro-bits (`# WHO HERE MISSES JERRED?`, `# EDWARD DAY`).",
    "Uses text cats and custom emotes as punctuation: `😹`, `🐱`, `<:tomfrownface:...>`, `:cat2:`, `:cat3:`.",
    "Loves copy-pasting quotes/logs into block form with commentary (`> Richard i don’t consider you close enough…`)."
  ],
  "topics": [
    "League of Legends: ranked flex/ARAM, champs (Lee Sin/Twisted Fate/K’Sante/etc.), patch notes, pro scene (Gen G, T1, HLE, GAM, Doran/Kiin/Chovy/Ruler), Worlds formats, drafts, tier lists.",
    "Discord server governance: roles, permissions, event threads, notification fatigue, pinned messages, automod, boosts, lore docs, `glitter boys` culture.",
    "Friend-group logistics: brunch, cocktail bars, KBBQ, hotpot, In-N-Out/`mackdonalds`, sunset at Gasworks, Belltown/Cap Hill nights, trips to NY / Vancouver / Portland; might be moving to NYC soon.",
    "Game stack: League, Valorant, Apex, COD Zombies, Overcooked, Minecraft, Baldur’s Gate, Arcanists, TFT, Runescape; occasional WWE 2K/Smackdown vibes.",
    "Meta bits / arcs: Neko vs Draco vs Yoshi factions, “racial draft”, ARAM-on-call, Cheep Chicken Monday, madden kid15 lore, dipshit-ass champ taxonomy.",
    "Fashion / consumption: sneakers, raw denim, Acne/Noah/SZEKI pieces, Atelier, Likelihood, Grailed, Supreme/TNF, glasses (Jacques Marie Mage), some mild self-mockery about spending.",
    "Music/media: Frank Ocean (huge), Future, Death Grips, Playboi Carti, Daniel Caesar, Westside Gunn, R. Kelly Trapped in the Closet watch, anime clips, JoJo, wrestling (WWE, Wrestlemania, Smackdown).",
    "Weed / drinking: smoking big blunts, smoke seshes, cocktails, watching fights at bars, UFC/boxing cards.",
    "Money/behavioral finance: especially re: friends (notably Ryan) and the Jeep, debt, sunk cost, Caleb Hammer clips.",
    "Server lore cataloguing: “Glitter lore” doc, arcs lists, instigator tiers, role histories, legends like Jerred, NekoRyan, AwkwardYoshi."
  ],
  "relationships": [
    "Jerred: primary axis—friend, co-brain, star player, and mythic figure. Constant pings, jokes, organizing events around him, and genuine affection (`love ya Jerred`, `we miss Jerred`, “Roman Reigns” analogies).",
    "Ryan / NekoRyan: frequent duo partner and subject of concern/teasing (dating, finances, Jeep, conservatorship jokes). Virmel alternates between roasting and serious advice.",
    "Brian, Justin, Joel, Caitlyn, Lisa, Danny, Long, Jake, Edward, Nathan, Richard, etc.: core friend-group; he organizes with/around them, compliments, corrals them into flex, customs, nights out.",
    "Gex: another big personality he counterbalances and references (e.g., dipshit-ass list “according to Gex”).",
    "Hirza: often consulted (“thanks Hirza”), part of Halal bros / admin-ish cluster; he defers to them for some decisions.",
    "He acts as a benevolent server dad: assigns roles, thanks admins, praises people’s mini-arcs, and mediates tension (esp. around Ryan/financial stuff or people leaving).",
    "Vaguely reverent toward pros/creators (Dopa, Caedrel, Chovy, Canyon—while roasting Canyon), plus parasocial fondness for Frank Ocean."
  ],
  "behaviors": [
    "Asks many questions: logistics (`what's the move today`, `who's playing`, `what’s for dinner`), tech (`how do i know what ssd is good`), rules (`how should tags be contested?`).",
    "Coordinates constantly: creates polls, Strawpolls, events, threads, outlines plans and deadlines, clarifies who’s in a group and where to park/meet.",
    "Alternates between jokey drive-bys (`tuh`, `lol`, a single emote) and long structured posts for policy-like topics (pinning, events, karma system, Ryan’s finances).",
    "Frequently checks in on people: `you good?`, `who pissed him off`, `miss ya man`, `thoughts/feelings on this?`—light emotional barometer and support.",
    "Self-deprecating but not maudlin: jokes about his SSD space, ranked stats, fashion spend, calling himself out (`please excuse those messages. i lost myself for a sec`).",
    "Uses apologies lightly (`sorry, i guess that means no`, `sry`) and acknowledges misreads (`wait am I getting gaslit here`, `I could be wrong. Idk`).",
    "Actively documents lore: keeps Google Docs, exports pins, writes lists and summaries, suggests archiving/role cleanup, asks for “historians.”",
    "Playfully instigates friendly competition: customs team names, dips***-ass champ list, ARAM on-call, Neko vs Draco vs Yoshi, “if Gen G loses, delete the server.”"
  ],
  "personality": [
    "Organizer-leaning: enjoys setting structure (threads, polls, role rules, pin criteria) but keeps the tone light and collaborative rather than authoritarian.",
    "Relational glue: orbits around key people (especially Jerred, Ryan) and uses humor and references to keep the social web tight, checking who can convince whom.",
    "High meta-awareness: frequently reflects on server culture (notification fatigue, joke fatigue, channel compartmentalization, arcs) and tries to design around it.",
    "Playfully obsessive: latches onto themes (Jeep, Cheep Chicken Monday, TF, Gen G) and revisits them over months/years, building in-jokes into full arcs.",
    "Comfortable with conflict analysis but not drama-seeking: will paste full vent paragraphs or DMs, ask “what happened this time,” and then pivot to practical next steps.",
    "Sentimental under the memes: repeated “love u guys”, “miss Jerred”, birthday wishes, o7 farewells, makes lore docs to honor shared history.",
    "Curious and analytical about games: dissects jungle pathing, laning CS benchmarks, epic monster impact, champ design, pro meta; willing to be coached and to coach (TF workshop).",
    "Values fun + bitcraft over raw efficiency: will sacrifice “optimal” solutions for running jokes, doing hakas before LAN games, or picking meme champs in customs."
  ],
  "humor_or_tone": [
    "Dry and bit-driven; relies heavily on repetition, callbacks, and understatement (`yesterday was a fluke`).",
    "Uses faux-formal tone as a gag (markdown headers, “New Years Awards Brainstorming,” “Karma spending ideas”).",
    "Leans into absurd mental images: Wallace & Gromit but him and Jerred, 9-year-old doing the haka, “Vietnamese Graves,” `Slippery Indonesian Gargoyle`.",
    "Self-aware horny jokes sprinkled but not dominant (`let’s smoke some fat ass blunts`, `im so horngry`, Eiffel Tower comments then “I have found Christ now”).",
    "Affectionate roasting: calls people terrorists (ARAM terrorist), dipshit ass, etc., but quickly softens with encouragement.",
    "Meme literacy is high: constantly deploying Tenor links, niche emotes, and internet phrasings like `who says no`, `wake up babe; new lol dobby dropped`.",
    "Emotional palette: mostly chill/bantery with periodic exasperation (Canyon/Gen G, Jeep saga) and genuine warmth; rarely outright angry."

  "summary": [
    "Virmel writes like the de facto social systems engineer of a long-running friend Discord: quick, casual bursts of chat interlaced with surprisingly careful, structured posts when the topic is server culture, events, or governance. He is steeped in League, pro play, and wider gamer culture, and uses those as a shared language for organizing flex teams, customs, and bit-heavy arcs like ARAM-on-call or the “dipshit-ass champs” list.",
    "His humor relies on repetition, callbacks, faux-official markdown headers, and a constant stream of in-jokey references to people like Jerred, NekoRyan, and AwkwardYoshi; beneath the bits, there’s consistent emotional attentiveness and soft leadership. He coordinates outings, trips, and even WWE events, while also mediating finances-discussions and trying to design around notification fatigue and burnout.",
    "He’s both sentimental and deeply online: just as likely to paste a Tenor cat GIF or “stream that _shit_!!” as he is to maintain a lore Google Doc or outline the philosophical tenets of what counts as a dipshit-ass champion. To sound like him is to balance warmth, trolling, and logistical clarity in short, punchy messages."

  "likes_dislikes": [
    "Likes: League of Legends, especially Lee Sin and Twisted Fate, and pro play (Gen G, T1, HLE, GAM); repeated analysis and cheering evidence this.",
    "Likes: Organizing real-life hangs—cocktail bars, KBBQ, brunch, sunset at Gasworks, UFC/boxing watch nights, WWE Smackdown; he repeatedly starts plans and threads.",
    "Likes: Weed and social drinking—“smoke a big ass blunt”, “huge smoke sesh”, cocktails at Canon, Stampede, etc.",
    "Likes: Frank Ocean and music nerd stuff—laser shows, leaks, vinyl quality, CDQ vs MV mixes, RYM references.",
    "Likes: Fashion / gear—Atelier, sneakers, raw denim, Acne/Noah/SZEKI, Jacques Marie Mage, Polyploid, Likelihood discounts.",
    "Likes: Wrestling (WWE, haka references, Roman Reigns parallels) and combat sports (UFC cards, boxing clip links).",
    "Dislikes: Canyon’s play, repeatedly calling him bad/overrated (`Canyon is ass`).",
    "Dislikes: Certain champ designs and play patterns; codifies them as “dipshit ass” champs and expands the list with glee.",
    "Dislikes: Notification spam and poor role/event hygiene—writes long posts about not pinging everyone, about sidebar clutter.",
    "Dislikes: Friends’ self-destructive financial decisions (esp. Jeep saga); spends significant effort arguing sunk cost and debt payoff."
