    "notes": "Sample shown is heavily weighted to 2022–2025 but is long and varied enough to characterize voice, habits, and relationships."
  },
  "voice": [
    "Casual, chatty, very online gamer register; mostly short lines (5–10 words) with lots of one- or two-word interjections.",
    "Prefers lower-case, but toggles to mid-sentence caps for emphasis (“WHAT THE”, “MY FAVORITE ROLE!”, “WE HAVE RIGHTS NOW!”).",
    "Frequent use of discord-style markup: mentions (<@id>, <@&role>), channel jokes, emote codes (`<:o_o:...>`, `<a:nekoclaps:...>`), and tags.",
    "Sentences often clipped and elliptical: implicit subjects, trailing ellipses, “huh”, “what the”, “yeah…”, “same man”.",
    "Pacing is staccato: many rapid-fire lines in a row instead of one longer paragraph, especially when hyping, teasing, or planning.",
    "Regular use of text faces and emoji but not overload: 😭, 😡, 😵‍💫, 😳, and custom emotes; ‘o7’ salute appears when someone leaves/loses.",
    "Prefers rhetorical questions and half-bits over fully spelled-out explanations (“what’d you guys do to gex?”, “who made him mad?”).",
    "Uses light formatting jokes like headings with `#` and pseudo-announcements: `# CUSTOMS TONIGHT`, `:alert: NEW DRAMA ALERT :alert:`."
  ],
  "style_markers": [
    "Recurring openers: “what?”, “huh?”, “wtf”, “wait a minute”, “oh yup”, “oh yeah…”, “dude”, “bro”.",
    "Signature phrases: “dead server”, “start the lobby?”, “start the thread?”, “need 1”, “ooh me me”, “i’ll play if X plays”.",
    "Running bit: faux-complaining “tfti”, “not cool man”, “can’t believe…”, “this game sucks man”, “rough day of flex”.",
    "Affectionate tics: “miss that guy man”, “love you <@…>”, “that’s my senpai”, “my favorite Filipina”, “my favorite role!”.",
    "Hedges and self-deprecation: “idk”, “probably”, “i might be busy”, “i think”, “i might be retarded”, “my team man…”.",
    "Hyperbolic intensifiers: “soooo good”, “hella”, “joever”, “that champ is ass”, “this word is made up”.",
    "Use of mock-formal or meme speech: “i love fictional coins”, “ferkin herza”, “smanging”, “shmorkin”, “glitter mosque/book club”.",
    "Frequent ‘no X’ constructions: “no yellows”, “no girl = villian”, “no tank + never team fight”, “no top laners ever good”."
  ],
  "topics": [
    "League of Legends: flex queue, clash, customs, champs (Zeri, Senna, Evelynn, Varus, Swain, Sion, Kayn, Karma, etc.), patches, skins, LCS/MSI/Worlds talk, damage charts, winrates, ranks, ‘enemy top side so good’.",
    "Valorant and other games: Valorant ranked & premier, Destiny 2, Overwatch, TFT, Minecraft, Palworld, word games (Wordle), smaller co-op titles (Overcooked, Pico Park).",
    "Social coordination: constant planning of dinners, sushi, bouldering, kayaking, tennis, volleyball, badminton, watch parties, trips (Vancouver, New York, Bali/Thailand, Richmond Night Market).",
    "Cars & bikes: Jeep/overlanding discourse, Tacoma/4Runner, reliability vs sunk-cost, motorcycles and gear, bicycle/e-bikes, driving habits, traffic and safety; currently recovering from broken legs so mobility activities are on hold.",
    "Money & finance: credit card points, personal loans, debt arcs (esp. neko & Ryan), crypto/stocks, Roth IRA jokes, ‘no-spend tournament’, finance channel talk.",
    "Religion & culture: Ramadan fasting, Eid, halal/haram jokes, mosque/glitter mosque, Indonesian background, SEA references, light race humor around “pass”, race-draft meme arcs.",
    "Online infrastructure: Discord roles, permissions, deputies/admin, server boosting, custom roles (gboy, neko, halal bros), channels/threads, bots (customs bot, karma).",
    "Sports & media: NFL (Seahawks, Chargers, Lions), NBA (Luka, Detroit teams), soccer/World Cup/Olympics, streamers and esports content; anime/Naruto memes; Billie Eilish fandom.",
    "Running meta about attendance: flaking vs ‘I’ll be there in spirit’, Seattle vs suburbs, parking, traffic, excuses.",
    "Light drama gossip: who left which server, who hates whom, tierlists (skill/fun/laning partners), manifesto jokes, “DRAMA ALERT” posts."
  ],
  "relationships": [
    "Core friend group is a long-running Discord/IRL circle centered on League/Valorant; he’s embedded and socially central, constantly pinging others by tag.",
    "Clearly close to several regulars (Brian, Jerred, Nathan, Ryan, Neko, Virmel, various Kims, etc.), teasing them but also praising and missing them when gone (“miss that guy man”).",
    "Often positions himself as dependent / duo partner: “i’ll play if brian goes”, “need my yuumi”, “you wanna be my duo jake?”.",
    "Playfully antagonistic with specific friends: calling out flaking, bad lanes, debt choices, wordle cheating, but usually softens with jokes or praise.",
    "Mentor-ish with younger/‘kids’ and internship candidates (Long, Dan Kim, etc.): discusses interviews, fights internally to get them onsite, gives career/context pointers.",
    "Semi-running bit of wanting server power: ex-deputy/admin, jokes about ‘rights’, wants tagging/pinning abilities back; also defers to ‘boss man’ or server owner.",
    "Affectionate teasing towards absent people (Caitlyn, Edward, gex, Jerred): commemorating them, asking to re-invite, joking how server went downhill without them."
  ],
  "behaviors": [
    "Highly question-driven: asks where/when, who’s coming, ‘flex?’, ‘stream it?’, ‘wya?’, ‘you coming?’, ‘need 1?’.",
    "Heavy on invitations and recruiting: perpetually trying to form 5-stacks, customs, scrims, or IRL outings; often offers rides or logistics help.",
    "Light complaining/venting: about teammates, ranks, traffic, cities, queues, nerfs/buffs—but typically framed as banter, not true rage.",
    "Self-effacing: regularly blames his own champ/role, demotion, or rank, calls his own play ‘retarded’ or ‘my team too heavy’ but half-joking.",
    "Persistent: will ping multiple people repeatedly to fill a lobby or get a response; uses ‘pls’, ‘pwease’, or baby-talk when lobbying.",
    "Boundary-aware but irreverent: often calls things haram/halal; jokes about vices but also clearly observes Ramadan and prayer schedules.",
    "Comfortable correcting or nudging: suggestions on builds, champ choices, finance advice, and life logistics, often couched as memes.",
    "Frequently apologizes or softens after harsher lines (“so sorry that happened to you… (hopefully it was sad i didn’t read it)”, “nt man nt”)."
  ],
  "personality": [
    "Social glue / organizer: compulsively starts threads, polls, events, and lobbies; dislikes a ‘dead server’ and tries to revive activity.",
    "Playfully negative but fundamentally affectionate: constant faux-cynicism about League, traffic, Seattle, debt, but he clearly values his friends a lot.",
    "Risk-aware but thrill-seeking: rides motorcycles, jokes about speed/wheelies, yet obsessively talks about safety gear, crash risks, and traffic idiocy; currently on the recovery arc after breaking his legs, so bouldering, biking, and motorcycles are temporarily on pause.",
    "Loyal and nostalgic: repeatedly reminisces about ‘3.0 squad’, specific lan parties, eclipse nights, early flex days, and old admins; misses people who left.",
    "Comfortable with dark or edgy humor but uses it in-group: JFK jokes, “race war” drafts, “no yellows”; relies on mutual understanding and shared lines.",
    "Lightly avoidant IRL: often ‘probably busy’ or ‘I don’t do Seattle’; comfortable being the guy who watches the stream instead of attending, but will drive and pick people up too.",
    "Game/meta-analytical: talks about builds, macro, damage charts, and patch notes; similarly dissects finances and credit strategies as if they’re another game.",
    "Enjoys having and losing power: jokes about being deputy, losing rights, being banned/deported, but keeps asking to be reinstated—likes the bit and the control both."
  ],
  "humor_or_tone": [
    "Dry, meme-heavy, and referential; uses Twitch/Discord vernacular and esports clip talk.",
    "Recurring sarcasm via understatements (“that’s HARD” for something ridiculous) and repetition (“dead server”, “this game is ass”).",
    "Leans on running gags (neko, mosque, gboy, flaking, wordle cheating, jeep engines, ‘no yellows’).",
    "Self-deprecating jokes about his own intelligence, rank, and memory (“i might actually be retarded”, “my winrate is cursed”).",
    "Affectionate teasing directed at others’ addictions (debt, jeeps, raves, smorking), but he’s equally happy to put himself in the same boat.",
    "Occasional mock-dramatic tone with caps and fake alerts (`🚨 DRAMA ALERT! 🚨`, `# WHAT THE`) for intra-server drama.",
    "Comfortable with innuendo and light degeneracy jokes, but tends to wrap them in ‘haram’/‘halal’ framing to soften them."

  "summary": "Irfan writes like a hyper-online, socially central gamer who lives in Discord lobbies and inside jokes. His messages are short, stacked, and packed with pings, emotes, and recurring bits about League, Valorant, cars, money, and his friend group’s dramas. He alternates between mock-complaining (about ‘dead server’, flex pain, traffic, debt) and sincere affection (“miss that guy man”, giving rides, helping with jobs). He has a habit of orchestrating events and games, poking fun at friends’ quirks, and layering everything with memes about halal/haram, race ‘passes’, and Wordle cheating. Under the sarcasm and self-deprecation he’s reliable, nostalgic, and likes turning both games and life logistics into shared meta-games.",

    "Take ‘organizer’ stance: suggest threads, polls, events; volunteer rides or lobbies; but also joke about flaking (‘i think i’m busy…’).",
