This policy applies to Scout for League of Legends, a Discord bot that helps you track and analyze your League of Legends gameplay.

This policy applies to our handling of information about Discord users who interact with our bot. We refer to these users as "you" throughout this policy.

## What we collect and why

Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here's what that means in practice:

### Discord Information

When you interact with Scout for League of Legends in Discord, we may collect:

- Your Discord user ID and username
- Server/guild information where the bot is used
- Commands you send to the bot
- Your Discord profile information that is publicly available

This information helps the bot respond to your requests and provide personalized League of Legends data.

### League of Legends Data

When you link your League of Legends account or request game data, we collect:

- Your League of Legends summoner name and account details
- Match history and game statistics
- Ranked information and performance metrics
- Champion and item data from your games

We collect this data through Riot Games' official API to provide you with gameplay analysis, statistics, and insights.

We never sell your personal information to third parties.

### Usage Data

We may collect information about how you use the bot, such as:

- Which commands you use most frequently
- Error logs when something goes wrong
- Basic usage statistics to help improve the service

This helps us understand how the bot is being used and identify areas for improvement.

### No Advertising or Cookies

Since Scout for League of Legends is a Discord bot, we do not use advertising, cookies, or web tracking. We do not collect browsing data or run advertisements.

## When we access or disclose your information

**To provide the service you've requested**. We access Discord's API and Riot Games' API to provide the bot's functionality. Your Discord data is processed according to Discord's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Your League of Legends data is accessed through Riot Games' official API according to their Terms of Service.

**To fix problems with your permission**. If you report a bug or issue, we may need to look at logs or data related to your specific case to diagnose the problem. We'll only do this with your permission.

**For safety and abuse prevention**. If we discover someone is using the bot in ways that violate our terms or to harm others, we may take appropriate action including restricting access.

**Aggregated data**. We may use aggregated, anonymous data for analytics and improving the service. This data cannot be used to identify individual users.

**When required by law**. If legally required to disclose information by valid legal process, we will comply with applicable laws.

## Your rights with respect to your information

We respect your data rights. Some of these rights include:

- **Right to Know.** You have the right to know what personal information is
  collected, used, shared or sold. We outline both the categories and specific
  bits of data we collect, as well as how they are used, in this privacy policy.
- **Right of Access.** This includes your right to access the personal
  information we gather about you, and your right to obtain information about
  the sharing, storage, security and processing of that information.
- **Right to Correction.** You have the right to request correction of your
  personal information.
- **Right to Erasure / “To Be Forgotten”.** This is your right to request,
  subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal
  information be erased from our possession and, by extension, from all of our
  service providers. Fulfillment of some data deletion requests may prevent you
  from using the service because the bot may no longer be able to provide personalized data.
- **Right to Complain.** You have the right to make a complaint regarding our
  handling of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory
  authority.
- **Right to Restrict Processing.** This is your right to request restriction of
  how and why your personal information is used or processed, including opting
  out of sale of your personal information. (Again: we never have and never will
  sell your personal data.)
- **Right to Object.** You have the right, in certain situations, to object to
  how or why your personal information is processed.
- **Right to Portability.** You have the right to receive the personal
  information we have about you and the right to transmit it to another party.
  If you want to export data from your accounts, you can do so directly by
  following these instructions for
  [HEY](https://hey.com/faqs/#if-i-don-t-like-hey-can-i-export-my-email-and-contacts),
  [Basecamp 4](https://3.basecamp-help.com/article/150-export-your-basecamp-data),
  [Basecamp 2](https://2.basecamp-help.com/article/247-exporting-account-data),
  [Basecamp Classic](https://classic.basecamp-help.com/article/524-exports),
  [Highrise](https://support.highrise-help.com/category/314-imports-exports),
  [Campfire](https://support.campfire-help.com/article/146-how-do-i-export-cancel-my-account),
  and
  [Backpack](https://support.backpack-help.com/article/289-can-i-export-my-data-out-of-backpack).
- **Right to not Be Subject to Automated Decision-Making.** You have the right
  to object to and prevent any decision that could have a legal or similarly
  significant effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes.
  This right is limited if the decision is necessary for performance of any
  contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on your
  explicit consent.
- **Right to Non-Discrimination.** We do not and will not charge you a different
  amount to use our products, offer you different discounts, or give you a lower
  level of customer service because you have exercised your data privacy rights.
  However, the exercise of certain rights may, by virtue of your exercising
  those rights, prevent you from using our Services.

Many of these rights can be exercised by signing in and updating your account
information. Please note that certain information may be exempt from such
requests under applicable law. For example, we need to retain certain
information in order to provide our services to you.

In some cases, we also need to take reasonable steps to verify your identity
before responding to a request, which may include, at a minimum, depending on
the sensitivity of the information you are requesting and the type of request
you are making, verifying your name and email address. If we are unable to
verify you, we may be unable to respond to your requests. If you have questions
about exercising these rights or need assistance, please reach out through the Discord server where you use Scout for League of Legends.

Depending on applicable law, you may have the right to appeal our decision to
deny your request, if applicable. We will provide information about how to
exercise that right in our response denying the request. You also have the right
to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. If you are in the EU or UK,
you can contact your data protection authority to file a complaint or learn more
about local privacy laws.

## How we secure your data

All data is encrypted via
[SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) when
transmitted from our servers to your browser. The database backups are also
encrypted. In addition, we go to great lengths to secure your data at rest. For
more information about how we keep your information secure, please review our
[security overview](../security/index.md).

With regard to products other than HEY, most data are not encrypted while they
live in our database (since they need to be ready to send to you when you need
them). With HEY, we go further by encrypting the database at-work. Every field
containing personal data is encrypted with its own key. The disks storing the
data keys are encrypted as well. Our servers decrypt the data to send it to you
when you need it. You can learn more about our approach to security for HEY at
[https://hey.com/security/](https://hey.com/security/).

## What happens when you delete content in your product accounts

In many of our applications, we give you the option to trash content. Anything
you trash in your product accounts while they are active will be kept in an
accessible trash can for about 25 days (it varies a little by product). After
that time, the trashed content cannot be accessed via the application and we are
not able to retrieve it for you. The trashed content may remain on our active
servers for another 30 days, and copies of the content may be held in backups of
our application databases for up to another 30 days after that. Altogether, any
content trashed in your product accounts should be purged from all of our
systems and logs within 90 days.

If you choose to cancel your account, your content will become immediately
inaccessible and should be purged from our systems in full within 60 days. This
applies both for cases when an account owner directly cancels and for
auto-canceled accounts. Please refer to our
[Cancellation policy](../cancellation/index.md) for more details.

## Data retention

We keep your information for the time necessary for the purposes for which it is
processed. The length of time for which we retain information depends on the
purposes for which we collected and use it and your choices, after which time we
may delete and/or aggregate it. We may also retain and use this information as
necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce
our agreements. Through this policy, we have provided specific retention periods
for certain types of information.

## Location of site and data

Our products and other web properties are operated in the United States. If you
are located in the European Union, UK, or elsewhere outside of the United
States, **please be aware that any information you provide to us will be
transferred to and stored in the United States**. By using our websites or
Services and/or providing us with your personal information, you consent to this
transfer.

## When transferring personal data from the EU

If you are located in the EU and use Scout for League of Legends, your data may be processed in accordance with Discord's and Riot Games' respective privacy policies and data protection measures.

## Changes and questions

We may update this policy as needed to comply with relevant regulations and reflect any new practices. Whenever we make a significant change to our policies, we will refresh the date at the top of this page.

Have any questions, comments, or concerns about this privacy policy, your data, or your rights? You can reach out through the Discord server where you use the bot.
