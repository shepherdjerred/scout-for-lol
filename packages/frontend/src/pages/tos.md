# Terms of Service

**Last updated: September 26, 2025**

Thank you for using Scout for League of Legends! This Discord bot is designed to help you track and analyze your League of Legends gameplay. Since this is a free service provided by a solo developer, these Terms of Service help establish clear guidelines for everyone.

When we say "Service", "we", "our", or "us" in this document, we are referring to Scout for League of Legends, the Discord bot and related services.

When we say "You" or "your", we are referring to Discord users who interact with the Scout for League of Legends bot in Discord servers.

We may update these Terms of Service ("Terms") in the future. Whenever we make a significant change to our policies, we will refresh the date at the top of this page.

When you use our Service, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the latest Terms. There may be times where we do not exercise or enforce a right or provision of the Terms; however, that does not mean we are waiving that right or provision. **These Terms do contain a limitation of our liability.**

If you violate any of the Terms, we may restrict or terminate your access to the bot. Since this is a free service, we aim to be reasonable and fair in our approach.

## Usage Terms

2. You may not use the Service for spam, harassment, or any illegal activities.
3. You are responsible for how you use the bot and any data you request from it.
4. The Service is designed for legitimate League of Legends gameplay tracking and analysis.

## Free Service

1. Scout for League of Legends is completely free to use. We do not collect payment information and we do not sell your data.
2. Since this is a free service, we make no guarantees about uptime or availability, though we do our best to keep the service running smoothly.

## Service Termination

2. We may store some usage data and Discord information as needed for the bot to function properly.
3. We have the right to suspend or terminate access to the Service for users who abuse it, use it for spam, or violate these terms.
4. Any form of abuse or harassment directed at the service operator will result in immediate termination of access.

## Service Changes

1. As a free service operated by a solo developer, we may need to modify or discontinue features at any time without advance notice.
2. We will do our best to keep the service running, but cannot guarantee continuous availability.

## Privacy and Security

1. Your use of the Service is at your own risk. We provide this Service on an "as is" and "as available" basis with no guarantees.

## Service Ownership

1. Scout for League of Legends is provided as-is for your use. You retain ownership of any content you share with the bot.
2. The bot and its functionality are provided without charge, and you may not commercialize or resell access to the Service.
3. League of Legends and all related data are owned by Riot Games. We access this data through official APIs for legitimate gameplay analysis purposes.

## Features and Bugs

We design the Service with care, but make no guarantees that it will meet your specific requirements or expectations.

As with any software, the Service may have bugs. We work to fix reported issues when possible, but don't guarantee completely error-free operation.

## Liability

***You expressly understand and agree that Scout for League of Legends shall not be liable for any damages or losses resulting from your use of the Service. This includes but is not limited to any issues with data accuracy, service availability, or other problems that may arise. Use of this Service is entirely at your own risk.***
