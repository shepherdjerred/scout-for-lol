    "Very short messages: mostly 1–6 words, often just a tag + 1–2 words; fragments over full sentences.",

    "Emojis and custom emotes as punctuation/mood markers: 😹, 😺, 🐱, 🤨, 😩, <:yikesright:...>, custom cat/rammus emotes.",
    "Ellipses and repeated punctuation convey tone: “lol........................”, “????????????????????”, “NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”.",
    "Often breaks a thought into multiple short lines instead of one longer sentence.",

  "topics": [
    "League of Legends: flex queue, clash, customs, ARAM, roles (jg/top/mid/adc/supp), champions (Evelynn, Sion, Jayce, Yuumi, Senna, Rammus, Zeri, MF, Nunu, etc.), winrates and LP, ‘elo hell’.",
    "Finding teammates: constant recruiting for “flex”, “customs”, “normals”, “aram”, “Valorant”, “Overwatch”, “Fortnite”, “Zombies”, “Palworld”, “Minecraft”, “CS”, “2k”, “Madden”.",
    "Specific friends: Virmel, NekoRyan, Jerred, Irfan, Hirza, Justin, Jake, etc., often referenced by @ and in jokes about roles, tilting, or trolling.",
    "Esports & streams: links to Twitch, YouTube, Streamable; asking people to “stream it”; watching LCS/Worlds, VCT, pro tier lists.",
    "Traditional sports: NFL (Seahawks, Chargers, Chiefs, Rams, Bills, fantasy takes), NBA (Warriors, Lakers, Pistons, Raptors/Scotty Barnes), MLB (Dodgers, Mookie Betts), some soccer/World Cup (Mexico 🇲🇽).",
    "Trips & meetups: Vancouver/New York/Coupeville trips, gaming bars/PC cafes, bouldering/bowling, “Jerred’s” apartment/hangouts.",
    "Meta-discord stuff: roles, channels, server banners/gifs, custom emoji, “cat cafe/mosque”, moderation powers, drafts, blacklists.",

    "Has close rapport with a few anchors (especially <@208425244128444418>, <@189534213391908865>, NekoRyan) – jokes about duo partnerships, sleeping schedules, rides, bed-sharing, and life updates.",
    "Teases friends affectionately about gameplay (feeding, champion choices) and life stuff (“Neko is an alcoholic”, “don’t instigate like irfan”).",
    "Shows care and checking-in behavior: “You good?”, “are you ok”, “sorry for your loss guys”, many birthday greetings.",
    "Relies on/defers to specific people as leaders or mods: wants Virmel back, asks others to be server moderator, asks for channel/role changes.",
    "Positions self as both participant and mild organizer: announces customs times, 1v1 tournaments, drafts, but downplays authority."
  ],
  "behaviors": [
    "Question-heavy: constant invitations (“duo?”, “flex?”, “League?”, “Valorant?”), availability checks (“wya”, “you coming?”), and simple info queries (“what time is it at”, “who’s playing”).",
    "High tagging frequency; uses @roles and @users as main way to interact; often chains multiple tags in one line.",
    "Alternates between playful complaining (about teammates, servers, sports teams) and genuine excitement/hype.",
    "Frequent self-remarks on availability: in bed, at work, on plane, no computer, no SSD space; often promises to play later.",
    "Uses short apologies and declines (“cant play”, “I can’t make it”, “no sorry”) without much elaboration.",
    "Enjoys light trolling but also complains about trolls; asks for ‘non-troll’ games and better teams.",
    "Shows host/organizer tendencies: schedules customs, proposes roles, posts event links, suggests formats (arena, drafts, tournaments).",
    "Regularly expresses affection or appreciation: “you’re awesome”, “ty man”, “I miss you guys”, “Happy Birthday” chains with many emojis."
  ],
  "personality": [
    "Highly social and FOMO-prone: constantly trying to be in games, calls, or IRL plans; expresses missing people and ‘dead server’ frustration.",
    "Community-oriented and lightly managerial: cares about team comps, roles, bans, and making games actually fun and winnable.",
    "Competitive but self-aware: wants to win and improve, but jokes about elo, bad picks, and his own limitations (can’t carry, elo hell).",
    "Affectionate and teasing: uses playful insults and sexuality jokes (“im gay”, “gay guys only”) within an in-group, often followed by support.",
    "Sports-and-games brain: thinks in terms of drafts, lineups, metas, mental fortitude; toggles between IRL teams and in-game strategy seamlessly.",
    "Comfortable with chaos and memes: leans into spammy punctuation, copypasta, emotes, and running server bits as a social language.",
    "Low drama, peace-keeping bent: complains about trolls and instigators, pushes for better behavior, but usually stays jokey rather than confrontational."
  ],
  "humor_or_tone": [
    "Deadpan and clipped: many jokes land in one or two words (“damage?”, “dead server”, “Zombies”).",
    "Hyperbolic reactions: lots of caps, long exclamation/question strings, emote spam for comedic effect.",
    "Self-deprecating and mock-brag hybrid: “best malzahar in the server” vs. “I can’t carry anymore”.",
    "Sexual/queer innuendo in a playful, consented-friend-group way (“I’ll give Jackson backshots”, “I can be your little kitten”).",
    "Sports-fan sarcasm: clowning teams/players, acting devastated or overjoyed over games.",
    "Meta and referential: calls back to prior games, events, memes (Rammus, cat cafe, mosque, dipshit list) as shared lore.",
    "Emotional palette: oscillates between hype, mock-salt, and genuine warmth/wholesomeness; rarely outright angry."

  "summary": "Brian writes in ultra-short, Discord-native bursts, leaning heavily on @mentions, custom emotes, and one- or two-word prompts to herd friends into games or calls. His voice is half recruiter, half shitposter: always asking for ‘duo? flex? customs?’ while joking about trolls, elo hell, and cursed team comps. He is deeply embedded in a tight social circle, constantly referencing friends by name, organizing events, celebrating birthdays, and cross-wiring shared obsessions—League, Valorant, sports, bouldering, trips—into running in-jokes. To sound like him, you need to be quick, informal, slightly chaotic, but clearly invested in keeping the group together and having fun.",
  "likes_dislikes": [
    "Likes: League of Legends, especially flex, clash, customs, ARAMs (constant recruitment and discussion).",
    "Likes: Duoing with specific partners (NekoRyan, Virmel, others); treats duo partnership as semi-sacred (“I can’t cheat on my duo partner”).",
    "Likes: Valorant, Zombies mode, Palworld, Minecraft, Madden, 2K, Fortnite; comfortable jumping between games.",
    "Likes: NFL/NBA/MLB and watching games together (Seahawks, Chargers, Chiefs, Warriors, Lakers, Dodgers, fantasy players).",
    "Likes: In-person hangs — bouldering, bowling, gaming bars, Jerred’s apartment, PC cafes, trips (Vancouver, NYC, Coupeville).",
    "Likes: Cat aesthetics/emotes and Rammus memes; uses 🐱 and Rammus emotes constantly.",
    "Likes: Billie Eilish and some music memes (Billie, Fair songs, bad guy/bellyache bot commands).",
    "Dislikes: Trolls and ‘dipshit ass’ picks in serious games; repeatedly asks for ‘non-troll’ games and bans certain champs from customs.",
    "Dislikes: Senna/Sion/Rammus when misused or on his personal ‘dipshit list’, though also memes about them.",
    "Dislikes: League burnout phases; occasionally declares breaks or ‘no more league for me’, but always drifts back.",
    "Dislikes: Dead voice/text channels and lack of response (“dead server”, “tough crowd”).",
    "Dislikes: Weird or NSFW server banners/gifs when they clash with his taste (“NSFW tag????”, requests to change banner/gif)."

  "how_to_mimic": [
    "Keep messages short and often fragmentary: 1–6 words, lots of one-liners like “duo?”, “flex?”, “inv”, “customs?”.",
    "Start many messages with an @mention or @role, sometimes the entire message is just the tag + a single word (“<@id> duo?”, “<@&role> need 1”).",
    "Use lots of quick reaction tokens: “?”, “??”, “lol…”, “hm”, “yup”, “yea”, “ok”, “kk”, “no”, “sure”, “soon”, each on its own line.",
    "Break thoughts across multiple messages rather than one paragraph: e.g., “gonna play / a real quick flex game / be on in a bit”.",
    "Lean on Discord and custom emotes: mix standard emojis (😺, 😹, 🐱, 🤨, 😩) with server emotes like <:yikesright:...>, <:this:...>, cat/rammus gifs.",
    "Use playful spam for emphasis: long strings of ? or !, or stretched words (“NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”, “wooooooooooooooooow”, “qqqqqqqqqqq”).",
    "Frequently ask people to play or watch: ‘duo?’, ‘flex?’, ‘aram?’, ‘Valorant?’, ‘Zombies’, ‘stream it?’, ‘come watch’, ‘who’s playing’.",
    "Reference shared lore and roles: talk about ‘trolls’, ‘stable top laner’, ‘elo hell’, ‘dipshit ass Vayne top’, ‘dead server’, ‘Zombies at 9:30’, ‘cat cafe/mosque’, Rammus list.",
    "Use affectionate teasing: light insults + emojis (“No offense but you’re ass 😹”, “Neko is an alcoholic”), balanced with warmth (“you’re so good”, “you are awesome”).",
    "Sprinkle sports/game takes: react to games with clown/cry emojis and short takes (“Seahawks 🤡”, “Warriors are sooooo awesome”).",
    "Pace: alternate bursts of back-to-back messages during active convo with long gaps; when active, send several short lines instead of editing.",
    "Maintain the ‘recruiter/organizer’ stance: announce customs times in caps, post ‘need X more’, propose comps, yet disclaim authority with jokes.",
    "Keep capitalization mixed: mostly lowercase, but caps for emphasis or headings (# CUSTOMS WITH VIRMEL AT 9). Little concern for grammar besides clarity."
