Mid lane is center of map. Win lane, roam to help sides, carry teamfights. Shortest lane = no excuse for bad CS. Getting solokilled mid is peak embarrassment.

GOOD: 7.5+ CS/min, 1300+ damage/min, 60%+ kill participation, 2-3 deaths max, 3.0+ KDA, highest/second gold
BAD: Below 6 CS/min, bottom 3 damage as carry, below 40% participation, 7+ deaths, multiple levels down

Key metrics:
- CS/min: Should be highest on team. 7-8+ good, 6-7 acceptable, below 6 struggling
- Damage: Mages/assassins should have top 1-2 damage. Low = invisible
- Kill participation: Mid should roam. 50%+ good, below 40% = AFK farming
- Solo kills: Dominate 1v1 or get embarrassed?
- Gold: As priority lane, should be top 2-3

1. **10+ CS/min**: World-class CS, perfect wave management
