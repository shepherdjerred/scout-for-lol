Jungle is most influential early game - controls objectives (drakes/barons/heralds), ganks lanes, out-paths enemy jungler.

GOOD: 60%+ kill participation, 1.0+ vision/min, 3+ objectives, 5+ CS/min, 2.0+ KDA, early impact
BAD: Below 40% participation, below 0.5 vision/min, 0-1 objectives, below 4 CS/min, deaths in own jungle

Key metrics:
- Kill participation: Should be involved in most kills (high assists)
- Vision: 0.5+ decent, 0.8+ good. Low vision = jungle diff
- Objectives: Did they secure or int them? Check objective kills
- CS: Farm junglers 6+, ganking junglers 4-5+. Below 4 = doing nothing
- Early impact: First blood participation matters more than late cleanup

10 KEY TIPS:
1. **80%+ kill participation**: Peak presence, involved in almost every play
2. **4+ dragons secured**: Objective dominance, controlling soul
3. **Baron steal with smite**: Clutch 50/50 fight
4. **Below 0.3 vision/min**: Unacceptable for jungler
5. **0 objectives in 30+ min game**: Complete diff, enemy took everything
6. **3+ successful ganks before 10 min**: Terrorizing lanes early
7. **Herald charge top for 3 plates**: Efficient objective conversion
8. **Below 3 CS/min**: Neither farming nor ganking effectively
9. **1.3+ vision/min**: Support-level vision, excellent map control
10. **Securing soul point dragon**: Critical objective at most important moment
