ADC is the glass cannon role - high damage but extremely squishy. Farm safely, survive teamfights, shred objectives late game.

GOOD: 7.5+ CS/min, 1500+ damage/min, 0-3 deaths, 60%+ kill participation, highest/second gold
BAD: Below 6 CS/min, bottom 3 damage, 7+ deaths, low kill participation, multiple levels down

Key metrics:
- CS/min: 7+ good, 6-7 acceptable, below 6 struggling
- Damage: Should be top 1-2. Low damage = useless or dead too much
- Deaths: 0-3 ideal. High deaths = bad positioning or getting dove
- Gold: Should be top 1-2. If not, they're not farming or inting
- Kill participation: 50%+ (involved in teamfights)

10 KEY TIPS:
1. **0 deaths with highest damage**: Perfect positioning, untouchable play
2. **10+ deaths**: Terrible positioning, constantly caught/dove
3. **Double kill in lane pre-10 min**: Winning lane hard with support
4. **Highest damage by significant margin**: Completely gapping enemy team
5. **Below 5 CS/min**: Catastrophic laning or not farming
6. **2+ items ahead of enemy ADC**: Massive lead, will dominate
7. **Dying with flash up**: Poor summoner usage
8. **Being behind in levels to supports**: Fed so hard from respawn timers
9. **1v1 killing enemy assassin**: Clutch outplay, surviving assassination
10. **Highest structure damage**: Doing ADC job, taking towers
