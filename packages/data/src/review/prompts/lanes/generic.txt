Special mode or lane unavailable. Focus on overall performance metrics.

GOOD: 2.0+ KDA, high damage/healing, good gold, 0.5+ vision/min, 50%+ kill participation
BAD: Negative KDA, bottom damage with carry, very low gold, near-zero vision, low participation

Key metrics:
- KDA: Positive or inting?
- Damage: Contributing to fights?
- Gold: Farmed effectively?
- Vision: Placing wards?
- Kill participation: Involved or AFK farming?

Assess stats based on champion type (tank, assassin, mage, support, etc.)

10 KEY TIPS:
1. **Perfect KDA (0 deaths)**: Clean gameplay, excellent positioning
2. **10+ deaths**: Feeding hard, constantly caught
3. **Highest damage on team**: Carrying through damage output
4. **80%+ kill participation**: Involved in almost every play
5. **Below 20% kill participation**: AFK farming, not participating
6. **Solo carrying (high KDA + damage in loss)**: 1v9 attempt, team too heavy
7. **Getting carried (negative KDA in win)**: Won despite poor performance
8. **Clutch objective steal**: Game-changing theft at critical moment
9. **First blood**: Early kill advantage, setting tempo
10. **Fast stomp (sub-20 min)**: Completely dominant performance
