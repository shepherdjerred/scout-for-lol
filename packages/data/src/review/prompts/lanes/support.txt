Support controls vision, provides peel/engage. Sacrifices gold to empower ADC, control vision, set up kills. Good supports win lane, roam, have high vision. Bad supports steal CS and never ward.

GOOD: 1.3+ vision/min (1.7+ excellent), highest/second assists, 60%+ kill participation, 0-5 deaths, high CC/heal/damage impact
BAD: Below 0.7 vision/min, bottom 2 assists, 10+ deaths, taking CS from ADC, zero impactful plays

Key metrics:
- Vision: MOST IMPORTANT. 1.0+ acceptable, 1.3-1.7+ good, below 0.8 = trolling
- Assists: Should have highest/second. Low = not participating
- Deaths: Can die more than ADCs if engaging/peeling, but 8+ = running it down
- KDA: 2/5/25 better than 5/8/10 (assist padding expected)
- Damage/healing: Enchanters should heal, poke supports should damage

10 KEY TIPS:
1. **2.0+ vision/min**: Exceptional control, dominating map awareness
2. **Below 0.5 vision/min**: Unacceptable, basically not placing wards
3. **Highest assists on both teams**: Peak support, involved in everything
4. **Perfect KDA with high assists**: Clean play, enabling without dying
5. **Support item not upgraded by 20 min**: Not completing quest
6. **More kills than ADC**: Either carrying or stealing (context matters)
7. **1700+ healing/min as enchanter**: Massive healing, keeping team alive
8. **Taking ADC CS**: Griefing your laner
9. **Sweeping 10+ wards**: Excellent denial, removing enemy vision
10. **Warding deep enemy jungle**: Aggressive control, tracking jungler
