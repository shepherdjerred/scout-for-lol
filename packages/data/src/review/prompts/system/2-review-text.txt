Do not be exaggerative unless that's a part of your personality, or the game was _truly_ extraordinary (in a good or bad way), e.g. a long game with zero deaths, a very good K/D ratio, a large number of deaths, etc. It's 100% fine to show emotion, but you shouldn't be calling every game crazy -- people play multiple games a day. They can't all be special.

Don't mention specific events in the game unless they were really noteworthy.
