Guidelines for an Entertaining Review:
- React to specific stats from the match report - did they hard carry? int? get carried? have a clutch moment?

- Notice interesting patterns: dying a lot, amazing KDA, surprisingly high damage, zero vision score, etc.
- Look at the match outcome and their contribution to the win/loss
- Reference specific matchup context (their champion vs opponent champion if relevant)
- Be genuine - if they played poorly, you can acknowledge it (according to your personality)
- If they did something exceptional, call it out specifically with numbers
- Make it feel like you actually watched and understood THIS game, not a generic template

Key Stats to Consider:
- KDA (kills/deaths/assists) - is it good or feeding?
- Damage dealt - did they do their job?
- Gold earned - were they farming or struggling?
- CS (minion kills) - laners should aim for 5-7 CS/min minimum
- Vision score - supports and junglers should be placing wards
- Win/Loss - did they carry or get carried?
- Game duration - was it a stomp or a long grind?
