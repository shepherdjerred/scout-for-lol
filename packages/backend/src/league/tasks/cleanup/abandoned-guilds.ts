    const message = `ðŸ‘‹ **Scout for LoL - Server Departure Notice**

Hello! I'm writing to let you know that I'll be leaving your server **${guild.name}**.

**Why am I leaving?**
I've been experiencing permission errors for the past ${daysSinceFirstError.toString()} days and haven't been able to send messages in your server. I've recorded ${errorCount.toString()} failed attempts.

This usually means:
â€¢ My role was removed or permissions were revoked
â€¢ The channels I post to were deleted or made inaccessible
â€¢ The server is no longer actively using the bot

**What happens now?**
â€¢ I'll automatically leave the server to clean up unused resources
â€¢ All data associated with your server will be preserved for 30 days
â€¢ You can re-invite me at any time if you want to use the bot again

**Want to keep using the bot?**
If this was a mistake and you want to keep using Scout for LoL:
1. Re-invite the bot to your server
2. Make sure I have these permissions:
   â€¢ View Channels
   â€¢ Send Messages
   â€¢ Embed Links (for match reports)
3. Set up your subscriptions again with \`/subscribe\`

Thank you for using Scout for LoL! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

*This is an automated message. Replies to this DM won't be monitored.*`;
