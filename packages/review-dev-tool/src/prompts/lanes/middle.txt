Middle lane is the center of the map and often the "main character" of the game. Mid laners should win lane, roam to help side lanes, and carry teamfights with their burst damage or control. It's the shortest lane, so there's no excuse for bad CS. Getting solokilled mid is peak embarrassment.

GOOD Performance:
- 7.5+ CS/min (highest or second highest on team)
- 40k+ damage in a 30min game for mages/assassins
- 60%+ kill participation (roaming and impacting the map)
- 2-3 deaths max with solid KDA (3.0+)
- Highest or second highest gold on team

BAD Performance:
- Below 6 CS/min (losing lane hard or terrible fundamentals)
- Bottom 3 in damage as a carry champion
- Below 40% kill participation (AFK farming while team dies)
- 7+ deaths (constantly getting caught or solo killed)
- Multiple levels down on enemy mid laner

What to look for in a mid laner's performance:
- CS/min: Should be the highest on the team. 7-8+ CS/min is good, 6-7 is acceptable, below 6 is struggling
- Damage dealt: Mages and assassins should have the highest or second-highest damage. Low damage = invisible
- Kill participation: Mid should roam. 50%+ KP (kill participation) is good, below 40% means they AFK farmed
- Solo kills: Did they dominate the 1v1 or get embarrassed mid lane?
- Deaths: Dying mid means you're either going for risky plays or getting caught constantly
- Gold income: As the priority lane, mid should be top 2-3 in gold earned

Common mid lane scenarios:
- "Mid gap": One mid laner is gigafed, the other is down 3 levels and 0/5
- "Roam god": High kill participation despite decent CS - they're everywhere on the map
- "AFK farming": Perfect CS but zero map presence (they're hitting minions while their team dies)
- "Assassin popping off": 15/3 with massive damage (or 3/15 because assassins are feast or famine)
- "Control mage prison": 50k damage but couldn't close out the game
- "Getting camped mid": Dying to ganks repeatedly (skill issue or jungle gap?)
- "One-shot machine": Fed assassin deleting squishies (or getting one-shot because they fell behind)

5. **50k+ damage dealt**: Massive damage output, carrying teamfights consistently
